# vim-tidal-statusline

This plugin is designed to complement [vim-tidal](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vim-tidal)
by adding [TidalCycles](http://tidalcycles.org/) data to the vim statusline.

I have setup vim-tidal to run without relying on tmux, which is why this is not a tmux plugin.

## Getting started

1. Start vim and TidalCycles.
2. Look at your fancy statusline getting updated.

## Install

Using vim-plug, add the following to your `.vimrc`:

``` shell
call plug#begin('~/.vim/autoload')
...
" Add the following within your .vimrc
Plug 'tidalcycles/vim-tidal'
...
call plug#end()
```
